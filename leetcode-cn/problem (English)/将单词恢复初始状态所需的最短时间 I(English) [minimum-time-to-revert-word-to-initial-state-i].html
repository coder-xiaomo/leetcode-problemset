<p>You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> string <code>word</code> and an integer <code>k</code>.</p>

<p>At every second, you must perform the following operations:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Remove the first <code>k</code> characters of <code>word</code>.</li>
	<li>Add any <code>k</code> characters to the end of <code>word</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that you do not necessarily need to add the same characters that you removed. However, you must perform <strong>both</strong> operations at every second.</p>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> time greater than zero required for</em> <code>word</code> <em>to revert to its <strong>initial</strong> state</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> word = &quot;abacaba&quot;, k = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> At the 1st second, we remove characters &quot;aba&quot; from the prefix of word, and add characters &quot;bac&quot; to the end of word. Thus, word becomes equal to &quot;cababac&quot;.
At the 2nd second, we remove characters &quot;cab&quot; from the prefix of word, and add &quot;aba&quot; to the end of word. Thus, word becomes equal to &quot;abacaba&quot; and reverts to its initial state.
It can be shown that 2 seconds is the minimum time greater than zero required for word to revert to its initial state.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> word = &quot;abacaba&quot;, k = 4
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> At the 1st second, we remove characters &quot;abac&quot; from the prefix of word, and add characters &quot;caba&quot; to the end of word. Thus, word becomes equal to &quot;abacaba&quot; and reverts to its initial state.
It can be shown that 1 second is the minimum time greater than zero required for word to revert to its initial state.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> word = &quot;abcbabcd&quot;, k = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> At every second, we will remove the first 2 characters of word, and add the same characters to the end of word.
After 4 seconds, word becomes equal to &quot;abcbabcd&quot; and reverts to its initial state.
It can be shown that 4 seconds is the minimum time greater than zero required for word to revert to its initial state.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= word.length &lt;= 50 </code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= k &lt;= word.length</code></li>
	<li><code>word</code> consists only of lowercase English letters.</li>
</ul>
